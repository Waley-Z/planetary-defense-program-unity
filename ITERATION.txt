My previous gold_spike featured a different way of controlling the spaceship, but many students said it was too hard to control, and as a result I changed it to be more natural. One student suggested me to have more camera view in the direction where the player is heading, so I used cinamachine to acheive this. Some suggested more health, done. Most students were confused with the objective and also how to control the spaceship, so in p2-gold I had bold texts on top telling players what to do and how to play. Almost everyone though the previous game was too hard, and I decreased the difficulty. Some were not interested in the previous game, and I refined the game mechanics.
